pyDiscreteProbability
=====================

Description
-----------

pyDiscreteProbability provides a number of classes and functions for dealing
with discrete probabilities. These include joint probability tables
(``JointTable``), conditional probability tables (``ConditionalTable``), and
Bayesian networks.

This module is not intended for any production and/or scientific use. It was
developed for my own learning purposes thus serves a primarily education
purpose. The demands of production or scientific use, such as good numerical
conditioning and good verification and validation coverage are not guaranteed.
